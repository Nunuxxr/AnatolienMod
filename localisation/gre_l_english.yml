GRE_nationalschism:0 "National Schism"
GRE_nationalschism_desc:0 "From the time Greece declared its independence in 1821, it had been characterized by the constant rivalry between the Republican Government and each Monarch. This divide reached its limits during the Great War, where Prime Minister Venizelos openly clashed with the King so that Greece could join, even splitting the country in half and joining with the Government of National Defence. Many believe that had it not been for King Alexander's democratic tendencies, the Greco-Turkish War would have been lost in an instant, for the army would fight among themselves. Before we start thinking about expansionism or anything of the like, we should ensure that our country will not dissolve in the proccess."
